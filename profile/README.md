## About Us

Robotics at Iowa is an engineering club at the University of Iowa. We accept students of a wide background not limited to engineers. We even take some non-students. Our primary mission is to accelerate learning through hands on projects in the field of robotics. We are an entirely student led organization. This means no guard rails and no guidance. We embrace this challenge because it means every single success (and faliure) is purely the result of our own hard work and dedication

## Project

Our primary project is a mock mars rover of approximately 50 Kg which competes in rover challenges. Currently, we attend the Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC) every year in August. The team is working very hard to broaden the rovers capabilities so that it may compete in even more challenging competitions.

## How to Join

The best way to get involved is to just show up. We welcome everyone regardless of age, skill level, or academic background.

##### General Meeting Times:
- Thursday, 6:30pm in Chemistry Building W105
- Sunday, 1:30pm in Chemistry Building W105
